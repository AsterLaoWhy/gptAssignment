me-explain long short term neural networks to me as if I was a middle school student

ChatGPT

Sure, let's break it down!

Imagine you have a friend who loves to predict whether it will be a sunny or a rainy day. Your friend pays attention to the weather every day and remembers how it felt in the past. They're pretty good at predicting the weather for the next day based on their recent observations.

Now, let's say your friend decides to use a special notebook to keep track of the weather. Instead of just looking at today's weather, they also write down some important details about the weather from the past few days. This helps them notice patterns and make better predictions.

In a way, your friend is like a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. Just like your friend looks at the recent weather to make predictions, an LSTM looks at past information to make sense of the current situation. The "Long" part means it can remember things from a while back, and the "Short-Term" part means it can quickly update its predictions based on new information.

So, if your friend sees a pattern that whenever it's sunny for a few days, it usually rains afterward, they might use this information to predict that it's likely to rain soon. Similarly, an LSTM neural network uses its memory of past events to make predictions about what might happen next.

In summary, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network is like a smart friend who uses a special notebook to remember and understand patterns in the past, helping them make better predictions about what might happen in the future.
